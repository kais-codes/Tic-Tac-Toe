# Tic-Tac-Toe
I wrote the game of tic-tac-toe in Python using classes and methods. The game will be played in the bottom section of the code in a specified area using methods displayed in game.get_commands. It will check for valid moves, and if the moves are accepted, turns are updated to the correct plyaer. It checks for the win condition after every move to see if a player has won, once a player has won, no more moves can be made.
