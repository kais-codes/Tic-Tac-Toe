# Tic-Tac-Toe
I wrote the game of tic-tac-toe in Python using classes and methods. The game will be played using the method make_move(pos1, pos2) to set the pieces each turn. It will check for valid moves, and if the moves are accepted, turns are updated to the correct plyaer. It checks for the win condition after every move to see if a player has won, once a player has won, no more moves can be made.
