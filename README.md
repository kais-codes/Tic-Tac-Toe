# Tic-Tac-Toe
I wrote the game of tic-tac-toe in Python using classes and methods. The game will be played in the bottom section of the code in a specified area using methods. It will check for valid moves, and if the moves are accepted, turns are updated to the correct player. It checks for the win condition after every move to see if a player has won, once a player has won or if the game is a tie, no more moves can be made.
